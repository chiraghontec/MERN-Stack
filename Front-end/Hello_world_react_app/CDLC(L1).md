### 1. Setting Up a React.js Project
1. **Install Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.
2. **Create a New React App**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app hello-world
     ```
   - This will create a new folder named `hello-world` with all the necessary files for a React app.

3. **Navigate to Your Project**:
   ```bash
   cd hello-world
   ```

4. **Start the React App**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - This will start the development server and open your app in the browser.

### 2. Hello World Code
1. Open the project folder in a code editor like VSCode.
2. Go to the `src` folder and open `App.js`.
3. Replace the code inside `App.js` with the following:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

4. Save the file, and you should see "Hello, World!" displayed in the browser.

### 3. Explanation
- **Import React**: `import React from 'react';` is necessary to use JSX (JavaScript XML) in your component.
- **Function Component**: `App` is a functional component that returns some JSX to be rendered.
- **JSX**: Looks like HTML but is used in JavaScript to describe what the UI should look like.
